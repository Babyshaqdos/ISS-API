# ISS-API
Intro to APIs using ISS
Found an API online to code, seemed fairly simple so I figured it would be a good start. The API will pull data from http://open-notify.org/Open-Notify-API/ISS-Location-Now/ to display the location of the ISS, how many people are in space, and how long until it will reach a specified set of coordinates
